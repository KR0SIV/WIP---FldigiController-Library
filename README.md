# WIP---FldigiController-Library
An XMLRPC wrapper in C# to control the functionality of the fldigi software modem

This library once completed will allow you to reference it to send control requests to and recieve data from fldigi.
Rather than having to manually write out the xmlrpc required to communicate with it.

This is for a future fldigi project I intend to release once this library is completed.
